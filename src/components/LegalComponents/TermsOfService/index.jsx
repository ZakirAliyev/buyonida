To complete your Account registration, you must provide us with your full legal name, business address, phone number, a valid email address, and any other information indicated as required. Shopify may reject your application for an Account, or cancel an existing Account, for any reason, at our sole discretion.</p>
                            <p>You must be: (i) at least 19 years old; or (ii) if between 13 and 19 years old, you may only use the Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Service; or (iii) the age of majority in your jurisdiction (if older than 19), to use the Services. You confirm that you are receiving the Services for the purpose of carrying on a business activity and not for any personal, household, or family purpose.</p>
                            <p>You acknowledge that Shopify will use the email address you provide on opening an Account or as updated by you from time to time as the primary method for communication with you. You must monitor the primary Account email address you provide to Shopify and your primary Account email address must be capable of both sending and receiving messages.</p>
                            <p>You are responsible for keeping your password secure. Shopify cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to maintain the security of your Account and password. You are responsible for all activity and content such as photos, images, videos, graphics, written content, audio files, code, information, or data uploaded, collected, generated, stored, displayed, distributed, transmitted, or exhibited on or in connection with your Account (“Materials”).</p>
                            <p>A breach or violation of any term in the Terms of Service, including the Acceptable Use Policy, as determined in the sole discretion of Shopify may result in an immediate termination of your Services.</p>[](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms?shpxid=222dd762-CA08-48FF-E4D4-FF926B8FFCAD)

                            <h3>2.1 Store Owner</h3>
                            <p>The person signing up for the Service by opening an Account will be the contracting party (“Store Owner”) for the purposes of our Terms of Service and will be the person who is authorized to use any corresponding Account we may provide to the Store Owner in connection with the Service. If you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer, your employer will be the Store Owner. You must provide your full legal name, a valid email address, and any other information requested to complete the sign-up process.</p>
                            <p>If you sign up for an Account on behalf of your employer, then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind your employer to our Terms of Service. Upon completion of sign-up for the Service, if you have been enrolled in Shopify Payments, Shopify will also create a Google Pay account on your behalf.</p>[](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms?shpxid=222dd762-CA08-48FF-E4D4-FF926B8FFCAD)
                            <h3>2.2 Staff Accounts</h3>
                            <p>Based on your Shopify pricing plan, you can create one or more staff accounts (“Staff Accounts”) allowing other people to access the Account. With Staff Accounts, the Store Owner can set permissions and let other people work in their Account while determining the level of access by Staff Accounts to specific business information.</p>
                            <p>The Store Owner is responsible and liable for the acts, omissions, and defaults arising from the use of Staff Accounts in the performance of obligations under these Terms of Service as if they were the Store Owner’s own acts, omissions, or defaults.</p>
                            <h3>2.3 Domain Names</h3>
                            <p>Upon purchasing a domain name through Shopify, domain registration will be preset to automatically renew each year so long as your Shopify Account remains active. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to deactivate the auto-renewal function should you choose to do so.</p>

                            <h2 id="section3">3. Shopify Rights</h2>
                            <p>We reserve the right to provide our Services to your competitors and make no promise of exclusivity in any particular market segment. You further acknowledge and agree that Shopify employees and contractors may also be Shopify customers/merchants and that they may compete with you, although they may not use your Confidential Information in doing so.</p>
                            <p>In the event of a dispute regarding Account ownership, we reserve the right to request documentation to determine or confirm Account ownership. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, a scanned copy of your business license, government-issued photo ID, the last four digits of the credit card on file, or confirmation of your status as an employee of an entity.</p>
                            <p>Shopify reserves the right to determine, in our sole discretion, the rightful Account ownership and transfer an Account to the rightful Store Owner. If we are unable to reasonably determine the rightful Store Owner, Shopify reserves the right to temporarily disable an Account until resolution has been determined between the disputing parties.</p>
                            <p>Shopify reserves the right to modify or terminate the Services for any reason, without notice, at any time. Shopify reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>[](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms?shpxid=222dd762-CA08-48FF-E4D4-FF926B8FFCAD)

                            <h2 id="section4">4. Your Responsibilities</h2>

                            <p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without the express written permission by Shopify.</p>
                            <p>You will not purchase search engine or other pay-per-click keywords (such as Google Ads), or domain names that use Shopify or Shopify trademarks and/or variations and misspellings thereof.</p>
                            <p>You understand that your Materials (not including credit card information), may be transferred unencrypted and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. Credit card information is always encrypted during transfer over networks.</p>[](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms?shpxid=222dd762-CA08-48FF-E4D4-FF926B8FFCAD)

                            <h2 id="section5">5. Payment of Fees</h2>
                            <p>You will pay the fees applicable to your subscription to Online Services and/or POS Services (“Subscription Fees”) and any other applicable fees, including but not limited to fees relating to the processing of transactions under your Account (“Transaction Fees”), and any fees relating to your purchase of any products or services such as apps, domain names, or Third-Party Services (“Additional Fees”). Together, the Subscription Fees, Transaction Fees, and Additional Fees are referred to as the “Fees”.</p>
                            <p>You must keep a valid payment method on file with us to pay for all incurred and recurring Fees. Shopify will charge applicable Fees to any valid payment method that you authorize (“Authorized Payment Method”), and Shopify will continue to charge the Authorized Payment Method for applicable Fees until the Services are terminated, and any and all outstanding Fees have been paid in full.</p>
                            <p>Subscription Fees are paid in advance and will be billed in 30-day intervals (each such date, a “Billing Date”). Transaction Fees and Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at Shopify’s discretion. You will be charged on each Billing Date for all outstanding Fees that have not previously been charged.</p>
                            <p>If we are not able to process payment of Fees using an Authorized Payment Method, we will make a second attempt to process payment using any Authorized Payment Method 3 days later. If the second attempt is not successful, we will make a final attempt 3 days following the second attempt. If our final attempt is not successful, we may suspend and revoke access to your Account and the Services.</p>[](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms?shpxid=222dd762-CA08-48FF-E4D4-FF926B8FFCAD)
